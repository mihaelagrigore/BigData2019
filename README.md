# Overview 

This notebook represents my playground for experimenting with concepts of Network Science, using data freely available online.  

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science'>Network Science</a> is not that old and maybe not that popular yet. Likely the most famous people from the field are <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s'>Paul Erdős</a> and, more recently, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science'>Albert-László Barabási</a>. 

I was introduced to Network Science through <a href='https://github.com/Big-data-course-CRI/materials_big_data_cri_2019'>this course</a> and <a href='http://networksciencebook.com/'>this book by Barabasi</a> (freely available).
